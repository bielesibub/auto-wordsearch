# auto-wordsearch

Place to hold auto generated word searches generated from the BBC News website - https://www.bbc.co.uk/news

Any words that the system finds that are over 20 characters in length magically become something from My Little Pony! Looks a bit odd seeing Pinky Pie and Coronovirus on the same page.

I'll try to keep this updated as often as I am able

## Bit of background

I'm a father of 4 suffering with MS. With the scare of maybe having to spend months locked up with the kids I wrote a python based wordsearch generator for the family to use. The system can either take a bunch of words and stick them into a character grid or if no words are provided it trundles off to the BBC website and generates a wordsearch from whatever the top story is at that moment in time.

This thing has only been done because I don't want my kids stuck on their XBOXs for however long it takes for the Coronavirus scare to go away. 

Stay safe.
